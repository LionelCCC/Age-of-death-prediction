    "# **Survival Analysis Revamp: Death Prediction 2.0**\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "This project aims to revamp the original **death prediction model** into a **production-grade survival analysis system**. Instead of directly predicting an age of death, we model the **probability of survival over time**, accounting for censoring (individuals still alive).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Survival Analysis?**\n",
    "Survival analysis is widely used in **healthcare, finance, and customer retention**:\n",
    "- **Healthcare:** Predict patient survival rates.\n",
    "- **Finance:** Credit risk and loan default probabilities.\n",
    "- **Subscription Businesses:** Customer churn prediction (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Steps**\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Reframe as Survival Analysis**\n",
    "- Convert the dataset to survival format.\n",
    "- Use Python’s `lifelines` and PyTorch-based `pycox`.\n",
    "- Handle **censored data** (people still alive in 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Train Survival Models**\n",
    "- **Traditional Cox Proportional Hazards Model (`lifelines`)**\n",
    "- **DeepSurv (Neural Networks for Survival Analysis)**\n",
    "- **Transformer-based Time-to-Event Models (TFTs, Hugging Face Transformers)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Deploy as an API**\n",
    "- Wrap the trained model in a **FastAPI** server.\n",
    "- Package with **Docker**.\n",
    "- Deploy using **Google Cloud Run / AWS Lambda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Technologies Used**\n",
    "- **Libraries:** `lifelines`, `pycox`, `FastAPI`, `Hugging Face Transformers`\n",
    "- **Model Training:** Traditional (Cox Model) & Deep Learning (DeepSurv, TFT)\n",
    "- **Deployment:** FastAPI, Docker, Google Cloud Run/AWS Lambda\n",
    "\n",

    "> 📌 **Next Steps:** Run the first code cell to preprocess the dataset and train the baseline Cox Proportional Hazards Model.\n"
