    "# Age Prediction Using XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook focuses exclusively on implementing **XGBoost** for predicting **age of death** using a structured dataset. XGBoost is a powerful **gradient boosting algorithm** known for its efficiency and high performance in structured data tasks. It is widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to its scalability, robustness, and feature importance insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Notebook?**\n",
    "I have structured this repository to explore multiple modeling approaches **separately**, ensuring that each model is implemented in a dedicated notebook. This notebook is specifically designed to:\n",
    "- **Showcase XGBoost’s capabilities** in handling structured tabular data.\n",
    "- **Compare its performance against other models** (which are implemented in separate notebooks).\n",
    "- **Understand the strengths and limitations** of XGBoost in a regression setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What’s Covered in This Notebook?**\n",
    "✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  \n",
    "✅ **XGBoost Implementation**: Training an optimized **gradient boosting model** on the dataset.  \n",
    "✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize performance.  \n",
    "✅ **Training & Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and feature importance analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each model is trained and evaluated separately to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Stay tuned for additional notebooks showcasing **novel techniques and alternative modeling approaches**.\n"
