    "# Death Prediction Project: Exploring Novel Models with Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "This project explores predictive modeling techniques for death prediction using a dataset with demographic and temporal features. The goal is to predict the **year of death** for individuals based on the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models Implemented:\n",
    "- **XGBoost**: Used as a benchmark model, achieving ~78% accuracy for Â±1 year error tolerance.\n",
    "- **DF2M (Deep Functional Factor Models)**: Currently under implementation, leveraging sparse factorization, Gaussian Processes, and deep kernels for explainable and robust predictions.\n",
    "- **MOIRAI**: Planned implementation as another novel model for comparison, leveraging advanced transformer architectures for universal time-series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. **Benchmarking**: Evaluate baseline performance using XGBoost.\n",
    "2. **Novel Approaches**: Implement and test research-based models such as DF2M and MOIRAI.\n",
    "3. **Learning**: Showcase the ability to read, implement, and adapt cutting-edge research into real-world predictive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progress:\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: Completed with handling of missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.\n",
    "- **XGBoost**: Successfully implemented as the benchmark model.\n",
    "- **DF2M**: Currently under active development.\n",
    "- **MOIRAI**: Implementation planned as the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Finalize the implementation of DF2M and evaluate its performance against XGBoost.\n",
    "2. Integrate MOIRAI into the project to compare its performance on the same dataset.\n",
    "3. Analyze results and document key insights from the model evaluations.\n"
